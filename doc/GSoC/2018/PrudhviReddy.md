## Goals Achieved

**1. Documentation comments** - adding documentation comments to all classes and functions in the project and arranged code with good indentations

**2. Updated project** - updating project to latest react native and react version , updating all dependencies to latest version . adding file changes and dependencies changes and fixed some bugs

**3. Added intro screen** - Added app tour to first time users so that users will know all app features

**4. Added search Friends by username** - Added searching friends through username so that user can add his friends even when he dont know thier email ids and showing all the users with that name in a listview

**5. Added Multidex in android** - as it is heavy project the project is not compiling for kitkat android so added multidex inside project to make that work

**6. making placeholders in map editable and adjusted zoom levels** : for source and destination to be at exact position that user wants i added draggable markers and zoom levels for good UX and synchronized with previous maps working

**7. State segregation** - state segregation in each class so that data flows in only required classes thus improve performance

## Bug Fixes :

**1. Fixed Orientation** - fixing the rotation to portrait for ios and android due to no rerender after rotating device in react native . this needs to be updated

**4. Fixed Login Issue** - fixed login errors showing up for multiple social accounts logging in

**5. Fixed Logout Issue** - sometimes after pressing logout it again login user on refresh comes back to logout . this is due to clearing the store is taking time fixed it with a line of code

**6. Fixed calculate screen ui** - for normal screens and small screens the present implementation is working fine but for larger devices there is a ui glitch fixed it with line of code
